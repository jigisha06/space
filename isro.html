    <h1>About ISRO</h1>

    <h2>üåü How It Started</h2>
    <p>
      ISRO was established on 15th August 1969, under the guidance of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of India‚Äôs space program. He believed that space technology must be used for solving problems of ordinary people. ISRO was born with the vision of using satellites for development ‚Äì in fields like communication, education, agriculture, and disaster warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early days, the organization worked out of a small church in Thumba, Kerala. From these humble beginnings, India launched its first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975.

    <h2>üöÄ Why ISRO Was Formed</h2>
    <p>
      After independence, India needed technology that would help in its growth. Space was the key to solving real-world problems: reaching remote areas with education, managing natural disasters, weather prediction, and agricultural monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      ISRO was formed to build this capability in-house, without depending on foreign agencies. It aimed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Empower rural and urban development using space tech</li>
      <li>Create independent launch systems</li>
      <li>Use space for peaceful, developmental purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåê Global Image</h2>
    <p>
      ISRO has gained immense respect globally. With missions like <strong>Mangalyaan</strong> (Mars Orbiter) costing just ‚Çπ450 crores, India became the first Asian nation to reach Mars and the first in the world to do so in its maiden attempt. ISRO's approach of **"maximum output with minimum cost"** is praised by space agencies worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has successfully launched over 400 foreign satellites, making India a major player in the global space economy. Its launch vehicle programs (PSLV, GSLV, SSLV) are highly reliable and cost-effective, making ISRO a go-to agency for commercial launches.
