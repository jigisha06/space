            <h1>Aryabhata </h1>
            <h4>April 19, 1975</h4>
            <p>Aryabhata was India's first satellite, built entirely in India and launched by the Soviet Union from Kapustin Yar. Named after the ancient Indian mathematician-astronomer, the satellite marked India's entry into space-based research. It weighed 360 kg and was quasispherical with 26 sides, powered by solar panels on 24 of them. Aryabhata carried experiments to study cosmic X-rays, solar neutrons, and gamma rays, along with sensors for ionospheric studies. Though it lost communication after four days, the satellite remained in orbit for several years. Aryabhata's launch was a key milestone, establishing India's capability to design and build satellites, and symbolizing national pride—it even featured on Indian currency for decades.</p>

            <h1>SLV-3 (Rohini-1)</h1>
            <h4>July 18, 1980</h4>
            <p>TSLV-3 marked India's entry into launch vehicle technology. It was a four-stage solid-propellant rocket that successfully placed the 35 kg Rohini-1 satellite into low Earth orbit from Sriharikota. This mission made India the sixth nation to develop and launch satellites indigenously. Rohini-1 carried instruments to measure Earth's atmosphere and radio signals. Led by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the project laid the foundation for future launch vehicles like PSLV and GSLV. Though earlier SLV flights faced challenges, this launch proved ISRO's growing technical maturity in orbital insertion and vehicle control systems.</p>

            <h1>INSAT-1B</h1>
            <h4>August 30, 1983</h4>
            <p>INSAT-1B was India's first fully functional multipurpose geostationary satellite. Built by Ford Aerospace and launched from the US, it supported telecommunication, weather forecasting, disaster warnings, and television broadcasting. Positioned at 83°E, it carried 12 C-band transponders and a VHRR imager for meteorology. The satellite dramatically expanded Doordarshan's broadcast reach and connected remote areas with communication infrastructure. After the failure of INSAT-1A, this mission restored confidence and kicked off India's long-standing INSAT series. INSAT-1B played a crucial role in building space-based national services in the 1980s.</p>

            <h1>PSLV-D2 (IRS-P2)</h1>
            <h4>October 15, 1994</h4>
            <p>PSLV-D2 was the first fully successful launch of the PSLV rocket, placing the 800 kg IRS-P2 Earth observation satellite into Sun-synchronous orbit. The PSLV used a four-stage configuration with both solid and liquid propellants and became ISRO's workhorse vehicle. IRS-P2 carried remote sensing instruments like LISS for monitoring agriculture, forestry, and urban development. This mission validated PSLV's design and reliability, paving the way for future launches and commercial space services. It also marked India's growing autonomy in launching its own satellites without foreign rockets. </p>

            <h1>Chandrayaan-1</h1>
            <h4>October 22, 2008</h4>
            <p>Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar mission, launched aboard a PSLV-XL from Sriharikota. The orbiter, weighing around 1,380 kg, carried 11 scientific instruments from India, NASA, ESA, and Bulgaria. It orbited the Moon at an altitude of 100 km for nearly 10 months. Chandrayaan-1's most revolutionary contribution was the detection of water molecules on the lunar surface, using NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3). The spacecraft also deployed the Moon Impact Probe (MIP), which crash-landed on the Moon and carried the Indian flag, symbolically marking India's presence. It carried X-ray, infrared, and radar instruments to map the Moon's topography, mineral composition, and crust thickness.</p>

            <h1>Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission)</h1>
            <h4>November 5, 2013</h4>
            <p>Mangalyaan made India the first country to reach Mars orbit on its maiden attempt. Launched by a PSLV-XL, the 1,337 kg orbiter entered Martian orbit on September 24, 2014, after a 300-day journey. It carried five instruments to study the Martian surface, atmosphere, and methane presence. With a budget under $75 million, it became one of the most cost-effective interplanetary missions ever. MOM was expected to last six months but functioned for over seven years, delivering valuable data and over 1,000 images. It earned ISRO global respect for frugal innovation and deep space capabilities..</p>

            <h4>July 14, 2023</h4>
            <p>Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on the Moon's south pole, making India the first nation to do so. Launched aboard the LVM3 rocket, the mission included a lander (Vikram) and a rover (Pragyan), with no orbiter. The lander conducted seismic and thermal studies, while the rover analyzed lunar surface elements using LIBS and APXS payloads. The soft landing on August 23, 2023, showcased precision control, autonomy, and terrain navigation. It was a comeback after Chandrayaan-2's failed landing, proving ISRO's resilience and engineering excellence in planetary missions.</p>

            <h4> September 2, 2023</h4>
            <p>Aditya-L1 is India's first mission to study the Sun, placed in a halo orbit around the L1 Lagrange point, 1.5 million km from Earth. Launched by PSLV-C57, the 1,475 kg satellite carries 7 payloads to observe solar flares, corona, and magnetic storms. Key instruments include the VELC coronagraph and solar particle analyzers. Aditya-L1 provides continuous solar observation without Earth's shadow interference, helping predict space weather events that affect satellites and communication. The mission marks India's entry into solar physics and deepens our understanding of the Sun's influence on Earth.</p>
